<p>This is an attempt at creating a simple Web page on my phone during a train trip back to Oslo after my vacation</p>
<p>It's written on my HTC m8 Android phone, loosely based on W3C examples and was hosted on Github using the Internet provided in the train. This is my first attempt at this and it took about 3.5 hours to complete. The picture was taken during the trip and is of Mj√∏sa. </p>
